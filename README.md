# Fractures

## Overview
A project dedicated to learning graphics shaders and if the projects grows enough, potentially even a full webstapp framework. (looking at you Svelte ðŸ‘€)

## Vision
The goal is to create something where I can easily share creative pieces in the form of shader art paired with hopefully some nice haikus.
